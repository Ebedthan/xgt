> [!WARNING]
> You should add the `-k/--insecure` option to all your current command as the GTDB API has currently SSL issue.
> We have not yet decided to switch it as a default configuration as disabling peer SSL certificate verification can be a critical issue.

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

`xgt` is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) tool that enables efficient querying and parsing of the GTDB database. `xgt` consists of a collection of commands mirroring the GTDB API and providing additional parsing capability.

## üìã Features

### `search` subcommand
It offers both exact and partial matches, along with additional parsing capabilities. Additionally, it supports searching the GTDB using multiple names listed in a plain text file.

### `genome` subcommand
It can be used to retrieve information about a genome. The --metadata option provides concise genome metadata such as accession and surveillance data, while --history retrieves the genome taxon history in the GTDB. The default option fetches nucleotide, gene, and taxonomy metadata of the genome.

### `taxon` subcommand
This tool fetches information about a specific taxon. Users can search for
the direct descendants of a taxon and retrieve taxon genomes in the GTDB using partial or exact matches.

### Certificate verification

`xgt` through `ureq` performs peer SSL certificate verification by default.
To tell `xgt` to _not_ verify the peer, use the `-k/--insecure` option.
Currently (as of Apr 28, 2024), you should add this option to your command to get the desired result as GTDB API's server has a certificate issue.

## üîß Installing

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/Ebedthan/xgt.git
cd xgt

# If default rust install directory is ~/.cargo
cargo install --path . --root ~/.cargo
xgt -h
```

## üí° Example

```
# Search subcommand: search GTDB
## Search all Escherichia (genus) genomes
xgt search -kw g__Escherichia

## Search all genomes with genus name containing Escherichia
xgt search -k -o output.csv g__Escherichia

## Search from a list
xgt search -k -f list.txt

# Genome subcommand: information about a genome
## Get GTDB genome information
xgt genome -k GCA_001512625.1

## Get taxon history on GTDB
xgt genome -k --history GCA_001512625.1

## Get genome metadata
xgt genome -k --metadata GCA_001512625.1

# Taxon subcommand: information about a specific taxon
## Get direct descendant of a taxon
xgt taxon -k g__Escherichia

## Search for a taxon in GTDB's current release
xgt taxon -kw --search g__Escherichia

## Search for a taxon in GTDB's current release with partial matching
xgt taxon -k --search g__Escherichia
```
